puppet-hadoop
=============

A puppet module built to completely install hadoop at the most basic usable level, based on bcarpio/puppet-hadoop, it had near complete overhaul and update.

Installing Hadoop to Machines
-----------------------------

1. Install the module by cloning the repository into /etc/puppet/modules directory under a folder named hadoop

2. In the modules/hadoop/manifests/params.pp file edit these parameters to match your setup:
<pre><code>$domain = $::hostname ? {
		default 		=> ".bigdata.lab",
	}

	$master = $::hostname ? {
		default			=> "hadoopMaster",
	}
       
	$slaveprefix = $::hostname ? {
		default 		=> "hadoopSlave",
	}

	$numofslaves = $::hostname ? {
		default 		=> "15",
	}
</code></pre>

3. Add into your site.pp:
<pre><code>node hadoopBase {
        class { "hadoop": }
        class { "java": }  
    }
    
    node /hadoopMaster/ inherits hadoopBase {
        class { "hadoop::master": }
    }
    
    node /hadoopSlave/ inherits hadoopBase { }
</code></pre>

At this point as long as your machines are running the puppet agent and have the right hostnames they should be installing hadoop. 

Starting Hadoop
---------------

Once all the machines have successfully run their puppet manifests simply SSH into your master node, and run /opt/hadoop/hadoop/bin/start-all.sh 

Updating Hadoop
---------------

In order to update hadoop to the latest version, download the most recent tar.gz file from http://hadoop.apache.org/common/releases.html and place it into the modules/hadoop/files directory. After downloading make sure to update the params.pp file with the latest version number. 

Dependencies
------------

bcarpio/puppet-java module for putting the latest version of Java onto the hadoop machines you can find it here: https://github.com/bcarpio/puppet-java and then it needs to be cloned into a folder named 'java' under /etc/puppet/modules
